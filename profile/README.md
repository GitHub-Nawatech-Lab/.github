It uses machine learning models trained on billions of lines of code to suggest whole lines or entire functions based on the context of what youâ€™re working on. By using Copilot, you can learn how to write better code and improve your productivity with a 55% increase in coding speed.
Don't miss out on the GitHub hackathon to learn how to use it, using a set of exercises (labs) that consist of building a web server using Nodejs with different functionalities, a .NET Web API or a Java Rest API (either Spring Boot or Quarkus). Join us and win exciting prizes.
